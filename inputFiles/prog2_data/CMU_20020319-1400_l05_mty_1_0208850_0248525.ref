cat yeah but you don't  ever need to use cat ever right you can just i mean most most programs will take standard in and you can just redirect standard in so for instance let us say you have like uh a table uh that is a flat text file that has like numbers in the first column words in the second column and then a whole bunch of other shit but you only care about the first two columns and you want them sorted by number you could first use the sort program on that file and then pipe it to another program that'll just print out the first two columns so
